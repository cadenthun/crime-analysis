# Group Members
Anagha Chandrasekharan, Randal Macias, Caden Thun, Vincent Por
# Project Description
In this project, we are looking to discover if there is a correlation between various crime scene tags (crime committed/crime code, victim age, victim descent, district number, and date) and whether a machine learning model can predict the victimâ€™s sex, based on open data from the city of Los Angeles. 
# Package Requirements
We used the following packages:
* numpy (1.21.5)
* sklearn (1.0.2)
* pandas (1.4.2) 
* matplotlib (3.5.1)
# Detailed Description of DEMO
1. Import various packages such as numpy, sklearn, pandas, and matplotlib.
2. Clean dataset using the data_cleaner class from CleanData.py.
3. Use matplotlib to illustrate coorelations between different data variables/crime scene tags and sex. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103856649/206104260-f04b8924-55fe-4bac-971b-bfbdf43a717f.png)
4. Split the data into a training set and a test set to train our machine on the dataset.
5. Use pyplot from matplotlib to graph a comparison between test data and train data to find a best-fit. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103856649/206104412-319efcce-3840-470a-9098-2c03b1e027ba.png)
6. Cross-validate data to improve the machine learning model.

# Background/Source of Dataset
Crime data from the City of Los Angeles (2020 - Present): 

This dataset contains an exhaustive list with details and information pertaining to incidents of crime in Los Angeles from 2020 and is regularly updated. This data consolidates information from the paper reports originating from the departments that responded to the incidents in question. Note that some of the parameters of the data may be redacted, not recorded, or otherwise missing.
