# Group Members
Anagha Chandrasekharan, Randal Macias, Caden Thun, Vincent Por
# Project Description
In this project, we are looking to discover if there is a correlation between various crime scene tags (crime committed/crime code, victim age, victim descent, district number, and date) and whether a machine learning model can predict the victimâ€™s sex, based on open data from the city of Los Angeles. 
# Package Requirements
We used the following packages:
* numpy (1.21.5)
* sklearn (1.0.2)
* pandas (1.4.2) 
* matplotlib (3.5.1)
# Detailed Description of DEMO
1. We imported packages: numpy and pandas as well as our custom class clean_data from Clean_Data.py.
2. Imported our dataset and used class clean_data to eliminate columns we did not need for our project.
3. Changed the names of existing columns to simpler names for future reference by replacing a list of old names with new names.
